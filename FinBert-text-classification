Text classification

This project is about text classification. You will develop a text classification system that identifies different kinds of online texts, such as news, blogs and opinionated texts. We will refer to these text categories as registers. If you want to learn more about online registers and their automatic identification, you can read, e.g., this paper: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-6130/
